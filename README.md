# RxPredict: Medicine Recommendation System

RxPredict is a machine learning-based recommendation system designed to suggest medicines based on symptoms entered by the user. The system leverages Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Collaborative Filtering techniques to provide relevant medicine recommendations.

## Project Structure

```
RxPredict/
â”‚â”€â”€ data/
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ medicines.csv
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ patient_history.csv
â”‚â”€â”€ models/
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ medicine_recommendation.pkl
â”‚â”€â”€ src/
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ __init__.py
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ data_preprocessing.py
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ train_model.py
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ recommend.py
â”‚â”€â”€ templates/
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ index.html
â”‚â”€â”€ static/

â”‚â”€â”€ app.py
â”‚â”€â”€ requirements.txt
â”‚â”€â”€ README.md
â”‚â”€â”€ .gitignore
```

## Features
- Accepts symptoms as input.
- Recommends relevant medicines based on patient history and symptom matching.
- Simple web interface using Flask.
- Uses NLP for symptom analysis.
